Autosmush
=========

[Read the introductory blog post](http://clickontyler.com/blog/2010/10/automatically-compressing-your-amazon-s3-images-using-yahoos-smush-it-service/).

Autosmush is a command line tool which scans an [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket
and losslessly compresses your images using Yahoo!'s amazing
[Smush.it web service](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/smushit/). It also adds a far-future
expires header on your images to aid in browser caching as recommended by
[YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/).

Autosmush can be run manually or as a cron job. It avoids re-smushing images by checking for an
'x-amz-smushed' HTTP header on already processed images.

FEATURESs
--------

 * Smushed images are automatically re-uploaded into S3
 * Avoids re-smushing images, so future runs take less time
 * Pass the '-t' parameter to do a dry-run and see how much space you could be saving
 * Adds far future expiration header to each file
 * Prints a summary of total bytes saved when complete

REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * Requires PHP5 and php_curl extension.
 * Requires the 1.6.x [AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php/releases). (Download and install instructions are located inside autosmush.)
